ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE SIMULATION: MOYO, FABIAN, AND MATHEUS GROUP

Project Description:
This project simulates a zombie apocalypse unfolding in a vast city known as Simville. Divided into various districts, each with its own population, the catastrophe originates from a virus mistakenly released from a lab.

Districts and Populations:

Downtown: 750 residents, with a predominance of uninformed individuals.
The 'Burbs: 500 residents, situated to the East of Downtown, largely uninformed populace.
University: 400 residents, positioned North of Downtown, home to the first individual who becomes alarmed.
Medical Hill: 350 residents, located Southwest of downtown, and was ground zero for the first zombie emergence.
Zombie Outbreak Dynamics:
The virus transmission occurs through bodily fluids, metamorphosing victims into pallid, cannibalistic undead. The epidemic begins at Medical Hill. As its effects become evident, Medical Hill residents spread the word, dividing Simville's population into the alarmed and the ignorant. While some heed the warnings, others disregard them, leading to increased conversions into zombies or casualties.

Simulation Objectives:
To analyze the numbers of:

Infected individuals
Casualties
Alarmed/alerted citizens
Ignorant inhabitants
Over a user-defined timeframe.

Project Specifications:

Zombie Encounter: The user determines the odds of an uninformed individual's conversion into a zombie or becoming alarmed and escaping upon an encounter.
Alarmed/Alerted Dynamics: Users input the probabilities for alarmed individuals either escaping from, neutralizing, or succumbing to zombies.
Zombie Mechanics: Zombies have a bite rate of once per day (one click = one day).
Cure Development:
Initiates on Day 1 at the University.
Progress relies on the district's zombie and uninformed count.
If alarmed individuals predominantly populate the city, cure development accelerates.
Detailed Use Case:

System: Zombie Apocalypse Simulation
Primary Actor: Researcher/User
Scenario:
The Zombie Simulation provides a dynamic portrayal of a viral outbreak that induces a zombified state in individuals. The user steers the fate of three groups: zombies, alarmed/alerted individuals, and the ignorant, leveraging probability metrics.
Users have the ability to set:
Chances of an ignorant becoming a zombie upon a bite.
Odds of an ignorant heeding an alarmed individual's warning.
Likelihood of an alarmed person turning into a zombie when bitten.
Probability of an alarmed individual eliminating a zombie.
Possibility of an alarmed person evading a zombie.
Outcomes, based on the set parameters, are then displayed, offering a daily breakdown of the status of the populace, culminating in a graphical representation.
This case showcases the interaction dynamics between the user (actor) and the simulation (system), predicting potential outcomes.
Example Parameters:

Chance of an ignorant becoming a zombie upon sight: 70%
Likelihood of an ignorant believing an alarmed individual: 40%
Odds of an alarmed person escaping a zombie: 20%
The probability of an alarmed person defeating a zombie: 40%
Chance of an alarmed individual turning into a zombie: 40%
(Note: The image provided cannot be visualized, but it presumably offers a graphical representation of these parameters.)

This project can serve as a valuable tool for researchers to simulate and understand the behavioral dynamics during a hypothetical zombie apocalypse scenario.
Chance of Alerted escaping from the zombie: 20%
Chance of Alerted killing the zombie: 40%
Chance of Alerted becoming a zombie: 40%
